## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
my_data <- my_data %>%
  mutate(predictions = predict(m, type="response"))

ggplot(my_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x=age, y=predictions, colour=condition))

```

The fitted model's age slope estimate is `r coef(m)[5]`.
## Including Plots


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
